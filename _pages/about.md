# Hey :wave:

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Applied Mathematics at the [Western University](https://www.math.uwo.ca/index.html), where I work under the guidance of [Dr. Xingfu Zou](https://www.uwo.ca/apmaths/faculty/zou/). 

I earned my B.Sc. with Honours in Applied Mathematics, complemented by a minor in Computer Science, from the University of Alberta in December 2021.

My research focuses on ``dynamical system`` and ``mathematical modeling``, particularly in the context of infectious disease dynamics. I am interested in developing and analyzing models to better understand disease transmission and control.
