I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of Western Ontario](https://www.math.uwo.ca/index.html). I received my B.Sc. in mathematics in December 2021 at the University of Alberta. My advisor is [Dr. Xingfu Zou](https://www.uwo.ca/apmaths/faculty/zou/). My research interests include `mathematical modelling` and `dynamical system`.
